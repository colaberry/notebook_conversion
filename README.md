# notebook_conversion

A standalone python application for benchmarking conversion of `*.ipynb` to `.html` file.

**Proposed Solution**

- Create a python file that pulls all the `*.ipynb` from a file and converts it into `.html` 
- Create decorators on each functions to measure time for ~150 files.
- Can also create a bash file that facilitates the same thing periodically on the server.
